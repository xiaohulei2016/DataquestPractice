    "In the first course in this step, __Machine Learning Fundamentals__, we walked through the full machine learning workflow using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. K-nearest neighbors works by finding similar, labelled examples from the training set for each instance in the test set and uses them to predict the label. K-nearest neighbors is known as an __[instance-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance-based_learning)__ algorithm because it relies completely on previous instances to make predictions. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm doesn't try to understand or capture the relationship between the feature columns and the target column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the __entire training dataset__ is used to find a new instance's nearest neighbors to make label predictions, this algorithm doesn't scale well to medium and larger datasets. If we have a million instances in our training data set and we want to make predictions for a hundred thousand new instances, we'd have to sort the million instances in the training set by Euclidean distance for each instance. The following diagram provides an overview of the complexity of k-nearest neighbors:\n",

    "We need to instead learn about __parametric machine learning__ approaches, like linear regression and logistic regression. Unlike the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, the result of the training process for these machine learning algorithms is a __mathematical function__ that best approximates the patterns in the training set. In machine learning, this function is often referred to as a __model__.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll explore the most commonly used machine learning model -- the __linear regression model__. Parametric machine learning approaches work by making __assumptions__ about the __relationship between the features and the target column__. In linear regression, the approximate relationship between the feature columns and the target column is expressed as a linear regression equation:\n",

    "We now have a decent list of candidate features to use in our model, sorted by how strongly they're correlated with the SalePrice column. For now, let's keep only the features that have a correlation of 0.3 or higher. This cutoff is a bit arbitrary and, in general, it's a good idea to experiment with this cutoff. For example, you can train and test models using the columns selected using different cutoffs and see where your model stops improving.\n",

Collinearity is when 2 feature columns are highly correlated and stand the risk of duplicating information. If we have 2 features that convey the same information using 2 different measures or metrics, we don't need to keep both.\n",

We can instead generate a __[correlation matrix heatmap](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/heatmap_annotation.html)__ using Seaborn to visually compare the correlations and look for problematic pairwise feature correlations.

When the values in a feature column have low variance, they don't meaningfully contribute to the model's predictive capability. On the extreme end, let's imagine a column with a variance of 0.

Linear regression operates under the assumption that the features are linearly correlated with the target column. For a categorical feature, however, there's __no actual numerical meaning__ to the categorical codes that pandas assigned for that colum.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last few screens, we focused on categorical values that were represented as text columns. Some of the numerical columns in the data set are also categorical and only have a limited set of unique values. We won't explicitly explore those columns in this mission, but the feature transformation process is the same if the numbers used in those categories have no numerical meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now look at numerical features that aren't categorical, but whose numerical representation needs to be improved. We'll focus on the Year Remod/Add and Year Built columns:\n",

    "...\n",

    "\n",
    "The two main issues with these features are:\n",

    "* Year values aren't representative of __how old__ a house is\n",
    "* The Year Remod/Add column doesn't actually provide useful information for a linear regression model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge with year values like 1960 and 1961 is that they don't do a good job of capturing how old a house is. For example, a house that was built in 1960 but sold in 1980 was sold in half the time one built in 1960 and sold in 2000. Instead of the years certain events happened, we want the __difference between those years__. We should create a new column that's the difference between both of these columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular piece of information (years until remodeled), this is a sensible approach. Domain knowledge can help you understand how to best transform features to represent information well for a linear model. If you're ever confused about a feature or how it should be represented, reading scientific papers or posts by researchers in the specific domain is critical. Many winners of __[Kaggle data science competitions](https://www.import.io/post/how-to-win-a-kaggle-competition/)__, for example, claim that their focus on data preparation and feature engineering combined with common machine learning models helped them win.\n",
