    "\n",
    "AirBnB is a marketplace for short term rentals that allows you to list part or all of your living space for others to rent. You can rent everything from a room in an apartment to your entire house on AirBnB. Because most of the listings are on a short-term basis, AirBnB has grown to become a __popular alternative to hotels__. The company itself has grown from it's founding in 2008 to a __[30 billion dollar valuation in 2016](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-05/airbnb-files-to-raise-850-million-at-30-billion-valuation)__ and is currently worth more than any hotel chain in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge that hosts looking to rent their living space face is __determining the optimal nightly rent price__. In many areas, renters are presented with a good selection of listings and can filter on criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type and more. Since AirBnB is a marketplace, the amount a host can charge on a nightly basis is closely linked to the __dynamics of the marketplace__. Here's a screenshot of the search experience on AirBnB:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img alt](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/airbnb.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a host, if we try to charge above market price for a living space we'd like to rent, then renters will select more affordable alternatives which are similar to ours.. If we set our nightly rent price too low, we'll miss out on potential revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy we could use is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* find a few listings that are similar to ours,\n",
    "* average the listed price for the ones most similar to ours,\n",
    "* set our listing price to this __calculated average price__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of __discovering patterns__ in existing data to make a __prediction__ is called __machine learning__. In our case, we want to use data on local listings to predict the optimal price for us to set. In this mission, we'll explore a specific machine learning technique called __k-nearest neighbors__, which mirrors the strategy we just described. Before we dive further into machine learning and k-nearest neighbors, let's get familiar with the dataset we'll be working with."

In this post, we'll be working with their dataset from October 3, 2015 on the listings from Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. Here's a __[direct link to that dataset](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/dc/washington-dc/2015-10-03/data/listings.csv.gz)__.

When we're working with larger data sets, we can't inspect each value to understand if there's one or some outliers or if all of the errors are systematically higher. Looking at the __ratio of MAE to RMSE__ can help us understand if there are __large but infrequent errors__. You can read more about comparing MAE and RMSE in __[this wonderful post](https://medium.com/human-in-a-machine-world/mae-and-rmse-which-metric-is-better-e60ac3bde13d#.lyc8od1ix)__.\n",

    "In this mission, we learned how to test our machine learning models using basic cross validation and different metrics. In the next 2 missions, we'll explore how __adding more features__ to the machine learning model and selecting a more __optimal k value__ can help improve the model's performance."

    "In the last mission, we explored how to use a simple k-nearest neighbors machine learning model that used __just one feature__, or attribute, of the listing to predict the rent price. We first relied on the __accommodates column__, which describes the number of people a living space can comfortably accommodate. Then, we switched to the __bathrooms column__ and observed an improvement in accuracy. While these were good features to become familiar with the basics of machine learning, it's clear that using just a single feature to compare listings doesn't reflect the reality of the market. An apartment that can accommodate 4 guests in a popular part of Washington D.C. will rent for much higher than one that can accommodate 4 guests in a crime ridden area.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 ways we can tweak the model to try to improve the accuracy (decrease the RMSE during validation):\n",
    "\n",
    "* increase the number of attributes the model uses to calculate similarity when ranking the closest neighbors\n",
    "* increase k, the number of nearby neighbors the model uses when computing the prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll focus on increasing the number of attributes the model uses. When selecting more attributes to use in the model, we need to watch out for columns that don't work well with the distance equation. This includes columns containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* non-numerical values (e.g. city or state)\n",
    "    * Euclidean distance equation expects numerical values\n",
    "* missing values\n",
    "    * distance equation expects a value for each observation and attribute\n",
    "* non-ordinal values (e.g. latitude or longitude)\n",
    "    * ranking by Euclidean distance doesn't make sense if all attributes aren't ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code screen, we've read the __dc_airbnb.csv__ dataset from the last mission into pandas and brought over the data cleaning changes we made. Let's first look at the first row's values to identify any columns containing non-numerical or non-ordinal values. In the next screen, we'll drop those columns and then look for missing values in each of the remaining columns.\n",

For example, the maximum_nights column has values as low as 4 and high as 1825, in the first few rows itself.

    "As we increased the k value from 1 to 6, the MSE value decreased from approximately 26364 to approximately 13657. However, as we increased the k value from 7 to 20, the MSE value didn't decrease further but instead hovered between approximately 14288 and 14870. This means that the optimal k value is 6, since it resulted in the lowest MSE value.\n",

This large amount of variability between the RMSE values means that we're __either using a poor model or a poor evaluation criteria (or a bit of both!)__. By implementing your own k-fold cross-validation function, you hopefully acquired a good understanding of the inner workings of the technique. The function we wrote, however, has many limitations. If we want to now change the number of folds we want to use, we need to make the function more general so it can also handle randomizing the ordering of the rows in the dataframe and splitting into folds.\n",

To build a better k-nearest neighbors model, we can change the features it uses or tweak the number of neighbors (a hyperparameter). To accurately understand a model's performance, we can perform k-fold cross validation and select the proper number of folds. We've learned how scikit-learn makes it easy for us to quickly experiment with these different knobs when it comes to building a better model.
