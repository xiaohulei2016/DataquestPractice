    "In previous missions, we primarily worked with data represented in a CSV file. The workflow looked something like this:\n",
    "![text alt](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/252/pandas_workflow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas workflow works well when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the data fits in __memory__ (a few gigabytes but not terabytes)\n",
    "* the data is relatively __static__ (doesn't need to be loaded into memory every minute because the data has changed)\n",
    "* only a __single__ person is __accessing__ the data (shared access to memory is difficult)\n",
    "* __security__ isn't important (security is critical for company scale production situations)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data __changes frequently__, requires __shared access__, doesn't fit in __memory__, and __security__ is critical, a __database__ is a much better solution. A database is a data representation that lives on disk that can be queried, accessed, and updated without using much memory. We primarily interact with a database using a __[database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)__ or __DBMS__ for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the pandas workflow, we spend most of our time thinking about what functions and methods to use, where to store intermediate results in variables, and juggling all of these. To work with data stored in a database, we instead use a language called __SQL__ (or structured query language). In SQL, we express each unique request (whether it be fetching a subset of or editing values in the data) as a single query and then ask the DBMS to run the query and display any results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to fetch a specific subset of the data from a database, we would:\n",
    "\n",
    "* write the SQL query: __SELECT * FROM salaries__\n",
    "* ask the DBMS to run the query and display the results to us\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the database workflow looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![text alt](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/252/database_workflow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data lives on __disk__, we can work with datasets that consume multiple terabytes of disk space. Many data science teams in industry have servers and setups in __cloud environments__ like Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services that let team members work with this scale of data. Robust and popular DBMS tools like __[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)__ and __[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)__ include powerful features for managing user credentials, security, and high data throughput (quickly changing data). In this course and the next, we'll learn the fundamentals of SQL using a small, portable DBMS called __[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)__. SQLite is the most popular database in the world and is __lightweight__ enough that the SQLite DBMS is included as a __[module in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sqlite3.html)__. In later courses, we'll dive into production systems like Postgres.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll explore data from the American Community Survey on job outcome statistics based on college majors. While the original CSV version can be found on __[FiveThirtyEight's Github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors)__, we'll be using a slightly modified version of the data that's stored as a database. We'll be working with the bit of data that contains the 2010-2012 data for recent college grads only. In this mission, we'll learn how to write SQL queries to explore and start to understand the dataset."

For example, if we wanted to write a query that returned all __Engineering__ majors that __either__ had mostly female graduates __or__ an unemployment rate below 5.1%, we would need to use parentheses to express this more complex logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three raw conditions we'll need are:\n",

This also goes for the column names (you can use either major_category or Major_category). We'll stick to using capitalized SQL and the original column names to stay consistent in these missions..\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing you may notice is how we enclosed the logic we wanted to be evaluated together in __parentheses__.
