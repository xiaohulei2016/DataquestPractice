A right join, as the name indicates, is exactly the opposite of a left join.

In these cases, using a right join is __preferable because__ it can avoid restructuring your whole query to join one table. __Outside of this__, right joins are used __reasonably rarely__, so for simple joins it's better to use a left join than a right as it will be easier for your query to be read and understood by others.\n",

    "Often quoted and paraphrased, this philosophy is especially important when writing SQL, where queries can quickly get visually complex. Taking the time to write your queries to be more easily understood will take a little extra time now, but will save you time when you come back to old queries that you have written, and help your colleagues when you're working in a data team.\n",
    "\n",
    "One obvious area when it comes to writing queries is the use of __capitalization and whitespace__. Because white space doesn't have any meaning in SQL, it can be used to help convey meaning in a complex query. Let's compare the same query written twice— first without whitespace and capitalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "select ta.artist_name artist, count(*) tracks_sold from invoice_line il\n",

    "And now, with whitespace and capitalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    ta.artist_name artist,\n",
    "    COUNT(*) tracks_sold\n",

    "ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, a little time put into whitespace and capitalization pays off. A few tips to help make your queries more readable:\n",

    "* If a select statement has more than one column, put each on a new line, indented from the select statement.\n",
    "* Always capitalize SQL function names and keywords\n",

    "\n",
    "Another important consideration when writing readable queries is the use of __alias names and shortcuts__. Name aliases should be clear– a common convention is using the first letter of the table name, however if you feel that a query is complex you should consider using more explicit aliases. Similarly, at times lines like GROUP BY 1 can be confusing, and explicitly naming the column will make your query more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work in a team, you might consider a SQL style guide— a great guide is available at __[SQL style guide](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/)__, but remember is that readability is more important than consistency. If you have a complex query and you think breaking the style guide will make it more readable, you should do it.\n",

    "We have been using schema diagrams to identify the relationships between tables. Below is an excerpt of the schema diagram for the Chinook database which shows the relationship between the __invoice and invoice_line__ tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img alt](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/192/chinook_pk_fk.svg)\n",

    "We previously learned that each table has one or more columns shaded in yellow, which indicates they are the __primary key__. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row - you cannot have two rows in a table with the same value for the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "When two tables have a __relation__, there will be a column in one table that is a primary key in another table. For example, in the invoice_line table, the invoice_id column is the primary key from the invoice table. This is known as a __foreign key__. By defining a foreign key, our database engine will __prevent__ us from adding rows where the foreign key value doesn't exist in the other table, which helps to __prevent errors__ in our data (note that by default SQLite doesn't force foreign key constraints, however we have __[changed the default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15301643/sqlite3-forgets-to-use-foreign-keys/44857286#44857286)__ for this mission).\n",

    "Usually, a primary key is specified as part of a create statement. Once the primary key is defined, the database engine will prevent any new rows from being added to the database if they have the same primary key as any existing rows.

In database normalization theory, there are several different phases of normalization, known as __[normal forms](http://www.bkent.net/Doc/simple5.htm)__. Knowing each normal form is not as important as understanding the goals of normalization, and designing your databases to avoid data duplication and integrity issues. We'll learn more about database normalization in the next mission, however for now let's look at how we can design our wishlist tables with normalization in mind:\n",
