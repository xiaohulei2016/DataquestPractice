    "In this project, you'll be working with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data on movie review scores. By the end, you'll have a notebook that you can add to your portfolio or build on top of on your own. If you need help at any point, you can consult our solution notebook __[here](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission209Solution.ipynb)__.\n",

    "The dataset is stored in the __fandango_score_comparison.csv__ file. It contains information on how major movie review services rated movies. The data originally came from __[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the first few rows of the data, in CSV format:\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " | FILM | RottenTomatoes | Metacritic | IMDB | Fandango_Stars | RT_norm | RT_user_norm | Fandango_votes\n",
    "---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- \n",
    "0 | Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) | 74 | 86 | 7.1 | 7.8 | 4.5 | 3.70 | 271107\n",
    "1 | Cinderella (2015) | 85 | 80 | 7.5 | 7.1 | 4.5 | 4.25 | 65709\n",
    "2 | Ant-Man (2015) | 80 | 90 | 8.1 | 7.8 | 4.5 | 4.00 | 103660\n",
    "3 | Do You Believe? (2015) | 18 | 84 | 4.7 | 5.4 | 4.5 | 0.90 | 3136\n",
    "4 | Hot Tub Time Machine 2 (2015) | 14 | 28 | 3.4 | 5.1 | 3.0 | 0.70 | 19560\n",

    "Each row represents a single movie. Each column contains information about how the online moview review services __[RottenTomatoes](https://rottentomatoes.com/)__, __[Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/)__, __[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)__, and __[Fandango](https://www.fandango.com/)__ rated the movie. The dataset was put together to help detect bias in the movie review sites. Each of these sites has 2 types of score -- __User__ scores, which aggregate user reviews, and __Critic__ score, which aggregate professional critical reviews of the movie. Each service puts their ratings on a different scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "* RottenTomatoes - 0-100, in increments of 1.\n",
    "* Metacritic - 0-100, in increments of 1.\n",
    "* IMDB - 0-10, in increments of .1.\n",
    "* Fandango - 0-5, in increments of .5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the primary score shown by the sites will be the __Critic__ score. Here are descriptions of some of the relevant columns in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* FILM -- the name of the movie.\n",
    "* RottenTomatoes -- the RottenTomatoes (RT) critic score.\n",
    "* RottenTomatoes_User -- the RT user score.\n",
    "* Metacritic -- the Metacritic critic score.\n",
    "* Metacritic_User -- the Metacritic user score.\n",
    "* IMDB -- the IMDB score given to the movie.\n",
    "* Fandango_Stars -- the number of stars Fandango gave the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to compare scores across services, the columns were normalized so their scale and rounding matched the Fandango ratings. Any column with the suffix ___norm__ is the corresponding column changed to a __0-5__ scale. For example, __RT_norm__ takes the RottenTomatoes column and turns it into a 0-5 scale from a 0-100 scale. Any column with the suffix ___round__ is the rounded version of another column. For example, RT_user_norm_round rounds the RT_user_norm column to the nearest .5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read fandango_score_comparison.csv into a Dataframe named movies.\n",
    "* Display the movies DataFrame by just typing the variable name and running the code cell.\n",
    "* If you're unfamiliar with RottenTomatoes, Metacritic, IMDB, or Fandango, visit the websites to get a better handle on their review methodology."
